        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The best way to make basic French toast, using only pantry staples.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 (1/2-inch thick) slices white bread</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling</li>
            <li>Pinch kosher salt</li>
            <li>Pinch ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter for the pan, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 200°F (93°C). If using very fresh, moist bread, arrange slices in a single layer on the rack and cook in oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat, swirling skillet, until foaming subsides, about 5 minutes. Soak 2 slices of bread in egg bath, turning, until saturated. Add soaked bread to skillet and cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle top side of bread with sugar, flip, and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer French toast to the rack in the oven in a single layer to keep warm and repeat with remaining slices of bread and egg bath.</li>
            <li>Serve French toast with pats of butter and maple syrup.</li>
        </ol>
